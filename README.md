# Repo for Storing Anycubic i3 Mega S prints/Mods that were useful

## Raspberry Pi

### Camera

Used a bog standard camera mount from Thingiverse, it's in [raspberrypi/Anycubic_I3_Mega_Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Mount](raspberrypi/Anycubic_I3_Mega_Raspberry_Pi_Camera_Mount)

### Mounting System

I printed a side case mount. This is a top from [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3723561), modified with display/camera/gpio holes using the scripts, and the base/mounting brackets from [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4462741](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4462741) - the top fits as the latter repo is a remix of the former.
